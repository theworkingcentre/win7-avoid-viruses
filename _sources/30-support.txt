Develop a support network
-------------------------

Computers and the Internet are confusing. As illustrated in previous
sections, sometimes things on the Internet are deliberately misleading.
It can be very helpful to have a support network of people you can turn
to for help when computers are confusing you. There are many resources
available locally:

-  The `Kitchener Public Library <http://kpl.org>`_ holds drop-in
   sessions for computer support Wednesday evenings.
-  The `Bits and Bytes computer club <http://bitsbytes.ca>`_ offers
   meetings and workshops for older computer users. They meet several
   times a month.
-  The Waterloo Public Library offers a `tech
   connect <http://www.wpl.ca/services/tech-connect>`_ service where
   volunteers can help answer your questions.
-  Volunteers at Computer Recycling can help answer some of your
   questions.
-  There are computer support volunteers in the public labs of The
   Working Centre who can also help answer questions.

In addition, you might find some friends or family members who can help
you. However, keep in mind that people who are very
knowledgable about computers do not always want to help you, and many
people who think they know a lot about computers actually don't. If you
are considering finding a computer buddy among your friends and family,
ask the following questions:

-  Is this person willing to help me? Does this person have the energy
   and time to do so, or would I be imposing myself?
-  Do I trust this person's judgement? Some people who know a lot about
   computers take unnecessary risks that can jeopardize your computer
   safety.
-  Does this person make me feel stupid when I talk with them about
   computer stuff? If so, that is a bad sign. You want to find somebody
   who will be patient with you, and who can explain computer concepts
   to you at a level you can understand.
-  How can I compensate and appreciate this person for their time and
   effort?

If you find a trustworthy computer buddy, you are very fortunate, and
you should be careful not to abuse this relationship by being overly
demanding. Asking these people for advice is usually quick; asking
them to fix your computer often takes a lot of their time, and you
should not expect them to do this regularly (especially if they are
helping you for free).
