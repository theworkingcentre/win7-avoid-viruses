What are viruses and malware?
-----------------------------

Using the term "computer virus" is a little misleading -- there are many
kinds of **malware** you want to avoid, and technically not all of them
are computer viruses. Some types of malware you might hear about
include:

-  Ransomware, which tries to hold your data files hostage unless you
   pay the virus makers money.
-  Scareware, which pops up scary messages about how your computer is
   infected, or that the FBI has caught you visiting illegal websites,
   and that unless you install their product you will get in trouble.
   Following the advice of scareware is always a bad idea.
-  Worms, which try to spread to other computers.
-  Spyware, which reports your activities back to somebody else.
-  Keyloggers, which record what you type in your keyboard (including
   passwords!) and report it back to somebody else.
-  Botware, which takes over your computer and makes it part of a
   **botnet**: a network of computers under somebody else's control.
   Criminals often rent time on botnets (in other words: using your
   computer without your consent or knowledge) to do assorted illegal
   things.
-  Trojans, which are computer programs that make it easier for other
   malicious computer programs to be installed on your computer.

Pretty much all of these are bad news.

How do viruses and malware get on your computer?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many different ways that viruses and malware can infect your
computer. Most often, it happens when you (intentionally or by accident)
download and install it:

-  You click on a bad link on a website or email.
-  You visit an infected website that installs software behind your
   back. This is much easier if your software is out of date and
   contains known exploits.
-  You download and run a strange email attachment.
-  You download and run some software which is bundled with a virus or
   other malware.

This is not a comprehensive list, of course. People devise newer and
scarier mechanisms for infecting computers all the time.

Why do people create viruses and malware?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some people create viruses for thrill and recognition. But these days
malware is often created for profit: individuals and organizations
looking for information or money by using your computer.
